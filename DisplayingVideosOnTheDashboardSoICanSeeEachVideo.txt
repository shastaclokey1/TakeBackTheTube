At the moment, all the videos on the dashboard are mushed together. I want to fix this so I can see each of the clickable dashboard video boxes.

- I will start by looking at the dashboard.ejs page that I have to see if I can fix this easily.
- I fixed it by simplifying.
	- I removed the flexbox calls and just used some padding and width css.
	- Now, there is a simple vertical column of videos on the dashboard whether I search for a query term or load a channel.
- Everything looks much more readable and I can scroll :)
- I like it.
- The dashboard still doesn't look pretty, but it is functional and that's all that matters to me.
- It is now definitely bed time.

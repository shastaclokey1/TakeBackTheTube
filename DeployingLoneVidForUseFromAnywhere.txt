The point of this document will be to explore the different options for deploying lonevid, pick one, and figure out what the capabilities per unit cost will be to see how expensive my site will be to operate.

- First, I will list out all the possible options for web hosting.
	- Heroku (I have used this before, but yt-search is crashing it).
	- Glitch (looks like it is a cool, developer focused, freemium option).
	- AWS with elastic beanstalk (looks like a flexible hosting service).
		bleh... amazon though.

- I figured out why my heroku app was crashing.
	- I had edited the yt-search.js file on line 837 to just use the full url for the thumbnail instead of the url split with a question mark delimiter.
	- The reason this is an issue is that there is a bug in yt-search that will crash the program any time there are null fields inside a playlist video.
	- I need to figure out if I can upload my own version of the yt-search module to heroku instead of pulling in the one with the bug.

The pont of this customizeable Youtube will be to have a place where all the videos I find will add positive value to my life.  

I do not want to incluede content from channels that catastrofize topics to hook viewers and gain more views.
	- This rules out channels like louder with crowder and tim pool.
	- I like their content and think there is a lot of truth in the videos they make, but I think the way they present that truth is too inflamatory and stresses me out more than it helps me learn about the world.

I want content that teaches me about cool things like investing, philosophy, politics, physics, tesla, spacex, biology, and genetic engineering.
	- I can add Hyperchange, Solving The Money Problem, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Bret and Heather Weinstien, Minute Physics, Vertasium, 3 blue 1 brown, numberphile, everyday astronaut, saildrone, tesla, spacex, and a couple channels that I need to ask sage about.

I want some content that is just for fun like basketball, mountainbiking, surfing, and snowboarding videos.
	- For these, I can add channels like espn, johny arnett, kale's brocoli, barefoot surfing, gopro, pinkbike, some other mountainbike channels, snowboard pro camp, and probably more I can't think of.

I think having this content will be a perfect way for me to learn about the world, expand my interests, deepen my understanding of my investments, have some fun when I want to relax, and do all of this without getting derailed by inflamatory videos.

	1. go to channel on youtube.
	2. Coppy the code at the end of the url.

The purpose of this document is to create an "About" page for Lonevid that explains why I built the site and how I hope it can help others.

- First I'll start with why I built LoneVid.
I built LoneVid because I was tired of looking at the time and realizing I had spent hours watching or listening to inflamatory clickbait videos when I could have been spending that time with people I care about, working on fun projects, or researching topics I was actually interested in. I was tired of not being able to remember seventy percent of the content I watched on a daily basis, yet still having to deal with the emotional state that all those videos left me in. I decided to build a site where I could curate only the content that added value to my life. I built LoneVid as a tool for myself to access the treasure trove of information stored in videos online without constantly getting distracted by reccomended content, clickbait titles, and targeted add campaigns. 

I have found that writing down my thoughts after watching a really interesting or entertaining video transforms my relationship with the content from a passive watcher to an engaged listener and thinker. I think that watching videos online can be a source of inspiration as long as the audience is given the tools to learn from the content. So many video platforms out there push the idea of engagement with videos by starting convorsations in the comments section or liking videos to show support for the creator. While I think there is absolutely a place for engement with others to share ideas, I think it is vitally important to have a private place to jot down thoughts before sharing those ideas with the world. I want LoneVid to be a tool anyone can use to find inspiration and have a private place to write down their thoughts before making the decision to share those thoughts with the world.

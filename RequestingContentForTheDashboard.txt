I have successfully requested a set of json data from the "Solving The Money Problem" youtube channel containing all the channel's uploaded videos.
	- I am able to get the video title, id, list id, duration, and author.
	- I want to get the description, but it doesn't look like this _parsePlaylistInitialData function has a description available.
	- I can think of two options.

Options for getting descriptions for videos on dashboard:
1. I can use the video ids I have successfully requested to perform individual video id quereys to get the description for each video in the entire list conglomorated from every channel.
	- I'll give this a try first.
	- For some reason the "push" command won't work for adding video info to an array that I plan to use to request details for each video.
	- I'm pretty tired and want to go to bed.
	- I'll look at this link in the morning to figure this out (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-array-of-objects-tutorial-how-to-create-update-and-loop-through-objects-using-js-array-methods/).
	- I was able to request each video's details, but the whole request time was super long.
		- I think I should go for method 2 and use this as a last resort.
		- I don't want it to take forever to load the dashboard.
		- Worst case I just won't have descriptions for the dashboard.
2. I can figure out how to hack the yt-search code to get a json response that has the video descriptions when I request a playlist.
	- Shiiiit. I got to the bottom of why the json didn't have the video descriptions for the channel uploads playlist.
	- The channel uploads page on youtube doesn't have descriptions for any of the videos.
	- Hmmm I don't want the dashboard to take forever to load by requesting the video details for every video on all the channels.
	- I will just have Title/Author/Duration on the dashboard.
	- I will think about adding video thumbnails to each item on the dashboard.

*****Plan for requesting content******
- I will use yt-search to request the uploads playlist for every channel I select.
- I will extract the channel name, id, duration, thumbnail, upload date, and title for each video into a object and add that DashboardVideo object to a list sorted by upload date. 
- I will use this list to propagate the dashboard.
	-This will be described in the doucument ConnectingYtSearchBackendWithDashboardFrontend.txt.
